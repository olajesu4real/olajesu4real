  I'm a multidisciplinary creator working at the intersection of **technology, music, design, and storytelling**. With a
  background in biology and experience across **fintech, public relations, and digital media**, I build human-centered,

  I'm passionate about making **tech meaningful, design intuitive**, and stories unforgettable.
